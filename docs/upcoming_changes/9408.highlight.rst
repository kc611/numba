Added initial implemantation for a new type system.
===================================================

This adds a new type system that will allow Numba to
differentiate between Python and NumPy scalars.

This has been achieved as follows:

- Retaining Numba's old type system as default.
- Adds a config flag USE_LEGACY_TYPE_SYSTEM set to `1`/ `on` by default.
  Switching it to `0` / `off` will activate new type system.
- Within the new type system, the python and numpy scalars will be treated
  and returned seperately as different entities through JIT compiled functions. 
- Additionally basic binary operations such as addition/subtraction can be
  performed with the newly added types.
